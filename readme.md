# Image Super-resolution

## Project Overview
I developed a deep learning-based super-resolution algorithm to upscale low-resolution strong lensing images using high-resolution samples as ground truths. The project was implemented using **PyTorch/Keras**, and I explored multiple models to achieve the best results.

### Dataset Description
The dataset consists of simulated strong lensing images at multiple resolutions:
- **High-Resolution (HR) images**
- **Low-Resolution (LR) images**
